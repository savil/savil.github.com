      <p>Private Crypto Finance is the use of cryptography as a tool to build a monetary system and financial economy on top of that system.</p>

<p>In industry and academia today, we are rapidly uncovering the new cryptographic tools that can be assembled for such a system to be built. Bitcoin was the first manifestation of such a new monetary system, which was later improved in two signficant ways. First, in terms of privacy by ZCash and Monero. Second, in terms of utility by Ethereum and its smart contract ecosystem. None are perfect mature systems, and have drawbacks in terms of scalability and user-friendliness. But they have demonstrated that ecosystems that can self-organize to manage monetary systems, and decentralized consensus building for their evolution.</p>

<p>Private Crypto Finance is the potential for these systems to offer a world where individuals directly control their money (via digital bearer-assets, not intermediated by corporate payment networks), where individuals are in charge of who gets to view their financial transactions (using cryptography to hide one’s activity by default, and reveal as necessary), and where money can be programmable to develop new financial products on top of these core properties.</p>

<h2 id="money-is-a-lever">Money is a lever</h2>

<p>“Give me a lever long enough … and I’ll move the world” said Archimedes. It’s generally accepted that technology is such a lever, and the more i have thought about it, finance and the monetary system is a lever for society to play with. Finance acts as a catalyst for the core underlying economic activity of society, which are the goods produced and services rendered. A well-designed financial system is one of the biggest levers we can have.</p>

<p>Crypto Finance built on cryptocurrencies is permissionless, since any developer around the world can publish a smart-contract, and thus is democratizing in offering this lever to any motivated person with access to the internet. Analogous to how anyone can publish a website, or a phone app, from around the world.</p>

<p>Working on creating such a lever is one of the highest impact work one can do.</p>

<p>Finance is often criticized for not building anything of value, and merely moving money around from one pocket to another. This is a cynical view i have come to reject. Finance, when done right, takes money from those who have it but don’t have a good use for it, to those who need it for meaningful productive uses. To do this right, Finance devises ways of managing risk for those giving the money away (e.g. credit ratings) and…</p>

<p>Most of the world suffers from underdeveloped financial institutions. Crypto Finance will see the development of financial institutions and norms that span the globe, offering people in countries with underdeveloped finance access to the same financial institutions as those in developed countries. Analogous to how anyone can use the same WhatsApp and same Gmail around the world.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-is-critical-to-new-money">Privacy is critical to new money</h2>
<p>As our lives get more digital, more of our financial lives occur online. They flow through payment intermediaries like Visa and AliPay. These intermediaries can control whether we are allowed to make payments, and can use this data to develop their own financial products – without our permission (ref. Social credit system in China). With cryptocurrencies, we now know how to invent new monetary systems with digital bearer assets. These don’t need intermediares to do payments.</p>

<p>However, being transparent networks, cryptocurrencies make it easy to surveil activity. This is especially true in 2019 where we have tools and knowledge (of big data collection, processing and finding insights in them) to uncover what individuals are doing from traces of their activity.</p>

<p>This makes privacy in cryptocurrencies critical for any open, liberal society. In the absence of privacy, we become unable to assemble and coordinate freely <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, and evolve our society to become better <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. As traditional financial systems get survielled, Private Crypto Finance offers a path to preserving the Right to Privacy in one’s financial activity.</p>
