<p>Benedikt Buenz
http://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs</p>

<p>initially designed to help with confidential txs, but can be applied to arbit computations</p>

<p>validity of btc tx:</p>
<ol>
  <li>sig is correct</li>
  <li>inputs are unspent</li>
  <li>sum of inputs &gt; sum of outputs</li>
</ol>

<p>But is neither confidential (tx amounts not hidden) nor anonymous (can see addresses coming from and to).
Confidentiality is important e.g. for businesses to not reveal suppliers and customers.</p>

<p>idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>instead of sending amounts, we send cryptographic-commitments (which hides the actual values)
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. Pedersen commitments</li>
      <li>but then how to check that sum of inputs &gt;= sum of outputs.</li>
      <li>turns out need to check that outputs are positive. (why?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Confidential txs [Maxwell 2016]</p>
<ul>
  <li>use zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge</li>
  <li>peggy: have commitment to a positive number</li>
  <li>verifier: prove it!</li>
  <li>verifier: here’s a challenge!</li>
  <li>peggy: here’s a response to prove it positive and Peggy knows
    <ul>
      <li>uses Range Proof, x is in [0, 2^52]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>can extend to NIZK (non interactive proof of knowledge)</li>
  <li>how to do range proof?
    <ul>
      <li>can decompose number into 52 bits</li>
      <li>peggy commits to all bits of number…explanation of Linear Range proof.</li>
      <li>bad: range proofs have 4kb for 64bit range proof, but good: don’t need trusted setup</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Preprocessing SNARKs with Trusted Setup (GGPR 13)
    <ul>
      <li>prover computes short proof (always 188 bytes regardless of thing being proofed), that is fast to verify.</li>
      <li>problematic: need to do setup. If malicious person does setup, then can be used to make “cheating proofs”.
        <ul>
          <li>cannot prove that there was a malicious setup. Any bad behavior is undetectable at this point.</li>
          <li>Low flexibility: any changes need new setup.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>proof time is k and so is verifiation time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>STARKS: CS Proofs (computationally sound)
    <ul>
      <li>very elegant but not practical, because proof-size becomes really large.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bootle et al ‘16: verification time is linear but proof time is log-sized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Bulletproofs (also applies to MimbleWimble):
    <ul>
      <li>can do proofs on committed values</li>
      <li>has lots of good properties: relies on discrete-log problem being hard (well tested) and can be used in any elliptic-curve problem.</li>
      <li>want it such that: can have multiple provers making a single proof without revealing their secrets to each other.</li>
      <li>designed a multi-party computation protocol for bullet proofs: which lets one combine the proofs into a single one.
        <ul>
          <li>either log(n) rounds and computation</li>
          <li>or …</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>reduces the UTXO set size by order of magnitude</li>
      <li>builtin CoinJoin protocol for combining confidential transactions</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        <p>Why not use BP for ZCash? problem: verification time for SNARK is constant, but for BP grows linearly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Applications:</li>
      <li>can use it for Solvency Proofs: Mt Gox must prove they are solvent
        <ul>
          <li>can provide a zero-knowledge proof that they are solvent
            <ul>
              <li>doesn’t reveal what each customer has, or even what they have in total</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>with BP proof size goes down from 60GB to 60KB (or so, handwaved)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>for smart contracts:
        <ul>
          <li>no trusted setup, for artbitrary computation</li>
          <li>proofs are short so tx size is kept small</li>
          <li>but verification time is linear, so may not be practical
            <ul>
              <li>workaround: refereed-delegation model (what TrueBit uses)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>for verifiable shuffles:
        <ul>
          <li>set of senders (with emails, phones, btc addresses) -&gt; want to shuffle -&gt; and want to send to recipients</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>found improvements when implemented in btc-security-lib
        <ul>
          <li>improving verification: can verify with one big “multiexponentiation”
            <ul>
              <li>well studied problem: it is sublinear N/log(N)</li>
              <li>BP are faster to verify than a SNARK (for small ciruit times)</li>
              <li>verifying takes 4ms. ECDSA sig verification is 5 times faster.</li>
              <li>batch verification also reduces down to doing one bug multiexponentiation
                <ul>
                  <li>4ms for each verification + 200mus for each additional proof</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>implies is practical for btc in terms of verification time. So, no real barrier to add this to btc.</li>
              <li>other problems: quantum unsoundness, and some more.</li>

<h2 id="dfinity-threshold-relay">Dfinity: Threshold Relay</h2>
<p>Timo Hanke</p>

<p>goal for PoStake:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fast consensus (5s): short block time, instant finality</li>
  <li>scalability (1m people)</li>
  <li>randomness:
    <ul>
      <li>for scalability in terms of sharding. Also, expose randomness from consensus algo into app layer via an op-code. (why?)</li>
      <li>should be unpredictable, unmanipulatable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>security (provable)
    <ul>
      <li>no selfish-mining, nothing-at-stake problems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>tadeoff between finality and scalability
e.g. PBFT chain (has finality after one block)
pow (finality probabilistically over time, manby nodes)</p>

<p>derive randomness from chain?</p>
<ul>
  <li>chain is manipulatable</li>
  <li>assumes everyone agrees on chain (but forkable!)</li>
  <li>hence:</li>
</ul>

<p>“last actor” bias:</p>
<ul>
  <li>last actor has info advantage, can see randomness that may be output and could abort. e.g. one actor, and she needs to roll dice in cup, but could peek under it and see 6 and reject it.</li>
  <li>any fallback mechanism (after abort) introduces bias</li>
  <li>e.g.: miner discards block, commit-reveal schemes (moved problem to when reveal happens that acotr could be bad)</li>
</ul>

<p>PoS attacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>causes of selfish mining and nothing at stake: sig are timeless and</li>
</ul>

<p>Obs 1: “threshold groups” have no last actor. a k-of-n threshold group have k actors who are necessary and sufficient.
Obs 2: “consensus without consensus”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BLS threshold sigs
    <ul>
      <li>private keys are split with groups. To combine, they make sig-shares which then combine (handwave) without revealing full key</li>
      <li>properties:
        <ul>
          <li>distributed key generation: no trusted dealer required.</li>
          <li>unique: for every message only one signature verifies. Note: this doesn’t imply deterministic.</li>
          <li>non-interactive: signature shares are created independently. Schnorr doesn;t satisfy this, but BLS does
Obs3: committee-size has ramifications, should be &lt; 50%.
Obs4: enforced publication</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>notarization: majority sig by a committee</li>
  <li>this notarization also serves as a timestamp, assuming each committee only active at a certain blockheight
    <ul>
      <li>but: a block could get half-notarized, if there is a timeout. An adversary can withhold sig-shares, and hold back the notarization.</li>
      <li>to fix: have block ref previous notarization (rather than prev block itself). this results in just one withhelf block but cannot have a withheld child-chain.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>q. how does one recover if a majority of validators is offline?</p>
<ul>
  <li>assume majority is honest (implying online). Otherwise, system stalls until enough validators come online.</li>
</ul>

<p>q. what are the tunable parameters?
this could be important when bootstrapping the network, or managing it over time as more participants join or leave.</p>
<ol>
  <li>committee size</li>
  <li>block time:
  rank block-makers, because we want to give them a higher chance of submitting their block to the notaries.</li>
</ol>

<p>q. fork choice rule?</p>
<ol>
  <li>block maker needs to pick fork on which to build next block (can have various algos to weigh diff forks)</li>
  <li>notaries need to decide which of the two proposed blocks to confirm.</li>
</ol>

<p>how do they regulate new participants joining?
they define block epochs (a seq of blocks, bookended by two “key frame” blocks)</p>

<p>protocol needs blockchain for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>currency, balances,</li>
  <li>market orders: bids, ask,</li>
  <li>allocations: which miners store what pieces</li>
  <li>proofs: verifiable record of correct beaviors</li>
  <li>contracts: state and execution of smart contracts</li>
</ul>

<p>miner’s power is proportional to useful-storage they provide network</p>

<p>markets for puts and gets can happen offchain, but for now is onchain to assist price-discovery</p>

<p>type DSN interface {
  Put
  Get
  Manage
}</p>

<p>DSN properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>complete,</li>
  <li>secure if assures data-integrity and retrievability,</li>
  <li>tolerates management faults ((f, n)-tolerant if f nodes accept n faults),</li>
  <li>tolerates storage-faults (f,m)-tolerant if Put stores in m independent storages can tolerate f faults, where m «&lt; n</li>
  <li>publicly verifiable</li>
  <li>auditable, via trace of operations</li>
  <li>incentive-compatible</li>

<h2 id="proof-of-replication-using-depth-robust-graphs">Proof of Replication using Depth Robust Graphs</h2>
<p>Ben Fisch</p>

<ul>
  <li>system can internally ensure files are being stored</li>
  <li>PoStorage:
    <ul>
      <li>proofs of data possession</li>
      <li>proofs of retrievability (similar to possession but with many queries can extract file)</li>
      <li>proofs of space: confirm that some resources are dedicated (could be junk!)</li>
      <li>proof of spacetime: storing space throughout period of time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data Generation Attack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>getting paid to store file, so generate junk data on the fly from some small seed on machine</li>
  <li>want proof: dedicating unique resources to storing data, even if can generate junk data
    <ul>
      <li>this removes incentive to cheat, so no benefit to gen-ing junk data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>proof of replication:</p>
<ul>
  <li>must incorporate the time-axis</li>
  <li></li>

<h2 id="tls-n-non-repudiation-over-tls-enabling-ubiquitous-content-signing">TLS-N: Non-repudiation over TLS enabling Ubiquitous Content Signing</h2>
<p>Hubert Ritzdorf</p>

<p>in TLS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alice can get data from server,</li>
  <li>but cannot forward to Bob, because it is encrypted with symmetric key encryption between alice and server</li>
</ul>

<p>may want to do so for e.g. for archiving.
better use case is: blockchain oracles</p>

<p>with smart contract on blockchain want to do something that requires on real-world data, and needs an external data source (called oracle) to help out.</p>

<p>requester/client &lt;– TLS conversation (http session or else) –&gt; generator/server &lt;…..CA verifies identity of server to client to verify server identity</p>
<ul>
  <li>can also have “verifier”(thirdparty/blockchain) that wants to learn something about the TLS conversation. (needs to trust CA)</li>
  <li>server sends “evidence” to client. Client makes proof from evidence and plaintext. client sends proof to verifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>possible problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>request-response can suffer from content reordering issues. e.g. what is price of btc? and response can come in other order.</li>
  <li>privacy: usually send GET request to server. use access_token. added in plain-text with encryption. but now, this will be exposed.
    <ul>
      <li>need redactable proofs!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>denial of service: if have 1 signature over everything. this may mean server gets very large state =&gt; DOS attack.</li>
  <li>redactability of proofs: if server has to decide what parts to redact. Means computational overhead on server =&gt; DOS attack.</li>
</ol>

<p>goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>small server side state and overhead</li>
  <li>client-side privacy protection (client decides what parts to redact and which to keep after getting response form server)</li>
  <li>clear context -&gt; total order on requests</li>
</ol>

<p>TLS-N overview:</p>
<ol>
  <li>start with TLS handshake.</li>
  <li>generate evidence: process small tls records with small state (on server). on client, needs to store all tls records and TLS-N parameters from handshake</li>
  <li>client “returns evidence” to server</li>
  <li>server “signs: evidence-generated + tls private key” + client’s evidence -&gt; sends evidence to client.</li>
  <li>client uses privacy settings to generate its proof, after any redactions it has done.</li>
</ol>
