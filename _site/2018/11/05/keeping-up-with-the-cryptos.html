      <p>The crypto world evolves quickly. I’ve found the following sources to be very useful for staying on top of weekly news.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.tokendaily.co/join-newsletter/pY6y">Token Daily</a>: newsletter with short news clips, aimed at both technical and non-technical audiences. Don’t miss their Tuesday Deep Dives. I always read this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://weekinethereum.substack.com/subscribe#about">Week in Ethereum</a>: newsletter. This goes into a ton of detail on just Ethereum. Its SO much detail that I can’t keep up, but I like to quickly browse once in a while.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://proofofwork.news">Proof of Work</a>: weekly newsletter. This collects updates from a bunch of projects, in short bullet-form. I like having it around to search for, when I want to learn about some project, but hard to keep up with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.cryptoweek.ly">Crypto Weekly</a>: newsletter. 3-4 quality news reports from the week. Events in the bay area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/">Bitcoin Optech</a>: weekly newsletter. High technical quality updates on bitcoin-core, and lightning projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://startupdigest.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=92be899ef5a892c60b4a6cd97&amp;id=1cd301e7d9">Startup Digest</a> - Silicon Valley-SF Bay Area. Weekly newsletter for startup events in the bay area. Often has some crypto links.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have curated the following lists on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/savils/lists/crypto">crypto</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/savils/lists/bitcoin">bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/savils/lists/ethereum">ethereum</a>. These give me news and entertainment at the same time :). Feel free to subscribe to them.</p>
