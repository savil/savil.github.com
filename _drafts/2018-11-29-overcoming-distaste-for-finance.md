title: Overcoming my distaste for finance
---

For the longest time, i've associated finance with greed. I'd bought into the stereotype of the Wall Street suit trying to manipulate markets to make a buck. Going to college at Stanford reinforced this, where the prevailing wisdom was to build technological products that people can directly use. Ditch the suit, adorn the hoodie. Leave the corruption of the financial world to the East Coast.

When i began looking into cryptocurrencies, and started working on some toy projects, i quickly realized that the most promising applications in the short-term were financial: for example, making Bitcoin payments work. As you can imagine, this led to some cognitive dissonance. What is the purpose of building these if they're just going to be used to enrich some "libertarian tech bros"?

Earlier this year, i began studying the tech behind cryptocurrencies, and then began working on some toy projects. However, i soon fell into a pattern where i'd start a project, and then inevitably hit some obstacle a few days in. At this point, since i had low conviction behind any project, i'd switch to my next idea instead of fighting through that obstacle and trying to solve it. After doing this a few times, i realized that i was actually fighting some cognitive dissonance. Most of the promising applications for the short-term in this space were financial, such as making an app for bitcoin payments via the nascent lightning network.
