title: Keeping up with the Cryptos
---

The crypto world evolves quickly. I've found the following sources to be very useful for staying on top of weekly news.

1. [Token Daily](https://www.tokendaily.co/join-newsletter/pY6y): newsletter with short news clips, aimed at both technical and non-technical audiences. Don't miss their Tuesday Deep Dives. I always read this.

2. [Week in Ethereum](https://weekinethereum.substack.com/subscribe#about): newsletter. This goes into a ton of detail on just Ethereum. Its SO much detail that I can't keep up, but I like to quickly browse once in a while.

3. [Proof of Work](http://proofofwork.news): weekly newsletter. This collects updates from a bunch of projects, in short bullet-form. I like having it around to search for, when I want to learn about some project, but hard to keep up with.

4. [Crypto Weekly](https://www.cryptoweek.ly): newsletter. 3-4 quality news reports from the week. Events in the bay area.

5. [Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/): weekly newsletter. High technical quality updates on bitcoin-core, and lightning projects.

6. [Startup Digest](https://startupdigest.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=92be899ef5a892c60b4a6cd97&id=1cd301e7d9) - Silicon Valley-SF Bay Area. Weekly newsletter for startup events in the bay area. Often has some crypto links.

7. I have curated the following lists on twitter: [crypto](https://twitter.com/savils/lists/crypto), [bitcoin](https://twitter.com/savils/lists/bitcoin), [ethereum](https://twitter.com/savils/lists/ethereum). These give me news and entertainment at the same time :). Feel free to subscribe to them.
